In September 2020, the BBC Shared Data Unit [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-54180359) how the number of GP appointments had reduced post-lockdown, with concerns from charities that some elderly people felt their GP was not "open for business".

It followed [a warning that week from the NHS](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-54138915) that doctors should make sure face-to-face appointments were available where medically needed, or face fines.

The Royal College of GPs said those in the profession had been left "bemused" and "angry" from the NHS England letter, however, as previous guidance had been to limit in-person contact with patients.

There were concerns over patients 'coughing and spluttering' in waiting rooms.

We found that in no CCG area in England were GPs offering the same percentage of face-to-face appointments as pre-lockdown. Nationally, there were 21.7m face-to-face appointments in January 2020 but that fell to 11.2m in July 2020.

## Methodology

We used data from [NHS Digital on GP appointments](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/appointments-in-general-practice) and collated them in R.
